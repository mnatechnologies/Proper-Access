      question: "How do I know if I'm eligible for the NDIS?",
      answer: "To be eligible for the NDIS, you must be under 65, an Australian citizen or permanent resident, and have a permanent and significant disability that affects your ability to take part in everyday activities. Contact us for a free eligibility assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Support Coordination and Specialist Support Coordination?",
