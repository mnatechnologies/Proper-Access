    {
      question: "What is NDIS Support Coordination?",
      answer: "NDIS Support Coordination helps you understand and implement your NDIS plan. A Support Coordinator assists you in connecting with providers, understanding your funding, and building your capacity to coordinate your own supports over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Access & Review Consulting funded by the NDIS?",
      answer: "No. Access & Review Consulting is delivered as a private, fee-for-service offering and is not funded through an NDIS plan. This service provides guidance and preparation support only and does not involve decision-making or guaranteed outcomes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who is NDIS Provider & Business Consulting suitable for?",
      answer: "This service is suitable for individuals or businesses seeking guidance on entering the NDIS space, including sole traders, allied health professionals, support workers, or organisations wanting clarity on registration pathways, compliance, and business setup considerations.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I'm eligible for the NDIS?",
      answer: "To be eligible for the NDIS, you must be under 65, an Australian citizen or permanent resident, and have a permanent and significant disability that affects your ability to take part in everyday activities. Contact us for a free eligibility assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support do you provide for NDIS access or reviews?",
      answer: "Proper Access provides structured guidance to help individuals and families understand eligibility requirements, organise supporting evidence, prepare applications or review requests, and navigate NDIA processes. Support is focused on clarity, preparation, and informed self-advocacy.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you complete NDIS registrations or applications on behalf of providers?",
      answer: "No. Proper Access does not submit registrations or act on behalf of providers. Instead, we offer consultative guidance, helping clients understand requirements, prepare documentation, and make informed decisions throughout the process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you guarantee NDIS access or a specific review outcome?",
      answer: "No. All decisions regarding NDIS access, funding, and plan outcomes are made solely by the NDIA. Proper Access operates independently and cannot guarantee outcomes, but supports clients to present their information clearly and appropriately.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this service connected to NDIS participant supports?",
      answer: "No. Provider & Business Consulting is a separate, privately delivered service and is not related to participant-funded supports or NDIS plans.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Support Coordination and Specialist Support Coordination?",
      answer: "Support Coordination helps participants with standard complexity needs, while Specialist Support Coordination is for participants with high or complex needs who require more intensive coordination and specialist expertise to implement their plans.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Support Coordination cost?",
      answer: "If Support Coordination is included in your NDIS plan, it's funded by the NDIS and there's no cost to you. The NDIS sets the pricing, and we work within your allocated funding. If you don't have Support Coordination in your plan, we can help you request it at your next plan review.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my Support Coordinator?",
      answer: "Yes, you have the right to choose your Support Coordinator and can change at any time. It's important that you work with someone you trust and feel comfortable with. We offer a free initial consultation to ensure we're the right fit for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "What areas do you service?",
      answer: "We provide NDIS Support Coordination services Australia wide. We offer both face-to-face and virtual support, ensuring we can assist you regardless of your location.",
